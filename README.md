Here are some PHP snippets I wrote and use regularly. Feel free to use them any way you like.

**object2array** ( $var )

_Recursively convert an object to an array_

**pre** ( $var, $tags=true, $doPrint=false )

_Return any $var as dumped string, wrapped in pre $tags. Set $doPrint to dump to browser directly. Useful for debugging._
